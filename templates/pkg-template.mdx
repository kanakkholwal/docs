A reusable boilerplate for authoring, linting, versioning, and publishing TypeScript libraries, with out-of-the-box CI/CD via GitHub Actions. 

## Features

- ✅ Written in TypeScript, ready for both browser and Node.js environments  
- ✅ Automated versioning & changelogs via Changesets to seamlessly handle version upgrades with PRs 
- ✅ Built-in `lint` and `release` workflows for npm publishing  
- ✅ Zero-config bundling with `tsup` 

## Setup
1. **Install dependencies** 
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Install the dependencies using `pnpm` (or `npm` if you prefer).
   - If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally using npm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Upgrade dependencies when needed**

   ```bash
      pnpx ncu -u
   ```
3. **Configure GitHub Secrets**  

   - Add `NPM_TOKEN` to `repository>settings>secrets and variables>actions` to publish package to npm registry
   - Upgrade `node-version` and `pnpm` version in workflow files if new `lts` version is available.
   - Navigate to `Repo > Settings > Actions. Something like: https://github.com/<YOUR-PROFILE>/<YOUR-REPO>/settings/actions.`
   - Enable the settings to `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`

## Dependencies

- [@changesets/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changesets/cli): Helps you manage the versioning and changelog entries for your packages, with a focus on versioning within a mono-repository (though we support single-package repositories too).
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript): TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.
- [tsup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsup): Bundle your TypeScript library with no config.
